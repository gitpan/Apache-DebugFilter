Filter Handlers
  "snoop_connection()"
    The "snoop_connection()" filter handler snoops on request and response
    data flow. For example if the HTTP protocol request is filtered it'll
    show both the headers and the body of the request and response.

    Notice that in order to see request's input body, the response handler
    must consume it.

    The same handler is used for input and output filtering. It internally
    figures out what kind of stream it's working on.

    To configure the input snooper, add to the top level server or virtual
    host configuration in httpd.conf:

      PerlInputFilterHandler  Apache::DebugFilter::snoop_connection

    To snoop on response output, add:

      PerlOutputFilterHandler Apache::DebugFilter::snoop_connection

    Both can be configured at the same time.

    If you want to snoop on what an output filter MyApache::Filter::output
    does, put the snooper filter after it:

      PerlOutputFilterHandler MyApache::Filter::output
      PerlOutputFilterHandler Apache::DebugFilter::snoop_connection

    On the contrary, to snoop on what an input filter
    MyApache::Filter::input does, put the snooper filter before it:

      PerlInputFilterHandler Apache::DebugFilter::snoop_connection
      PerlInputFilterHandler MyApache::Filter::input

    This is because "snoop_connection" is going to be invoked first and
    immediately call "MyApache::Filter::input" the input filter for data.
    Only when the latter returns, "snoop_connection" will do its work.

  "snoop_request()"
    The "snoop_request()" filter handler snoops only on HTTP request and
    response bodies. Otherwise it's similar to "snoop_connection()". Only
    normally it's configured for a specific "<Location>". For example:

      <Location /foo>
          PerlInputFilterHandler  Apache::DebugFilter::snoop_request
          PerlOutputFilterHandler Apache::DebugFilter::snoop_request
      </Location>

Functions
  "bb_dump()"
      my $ra_data = Apache::DebugFilter::bb_dump($bb);

    If only a bucket brigade $bb is passed, "bb_dump" will convert bb to an
    array of bucket_type => data pairs, and return a reference to it. This
    later can be used as in the following example:

      while (my($btype, $data) = splice @$ra_data, 0, 2) {
          print "$btype => $data\n";
      }

    If the second argument (expected to be an open filehandle) is passed, as
    in:

      Apache::DebugFilter::bb_dump($bb, \*STDERR);

    "bb_dump" will print pretty formatted bb's content to that filehandle.
